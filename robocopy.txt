/MON: n Monitors the source directory for changes, and runs again when n changes have been detected, and the minimum time interval specified by /MOT has elapsed.

/MOT: n Monitors the source directory for changes, and runs again when a further n minutes have elapsed, and the minimum number of changes specified by /MON have been detected.  

/RH: hhmm - hhmm Defines th e time slot during which starting new copies is allowed. Useful for restricting copies to certain times of the day. Both values must be 24 - hour times in the range 0000 to 2359.
